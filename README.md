#Ray Tracing Simulation with SDL2
<h3 align="center">This C++ project demonstrates a simple ray tracing effect using SDL2. A light source (represented as a circle) emits rays in 360 directions. When the user moves the mouse while holding a button, the light source follows the cursor, dynamically updating the rays' positions. The rays stop when they collide with an obstacle (another circle), creating a basic shadow effect. Features: Uses SDL2 to render graphics. Simulates light rays interacting with an obstacle. Real-time mouse movement detection to update the light source.</h3>
