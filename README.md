<h1 align="center">🌟 Ray Tracing Simulation with SDL2 🔦</h1>  
<h3 align="center">  
This C++ project demonstrates a simple ray tracing effect using SDL2. A light source (💡) emits rays in 360 directions. When the user moves the mouse 🖱️ while holding a button, the light source follows the cursor, dynamically updating the rays' positions. The rays stop when they collide with an obstacle (⚫), creating a basic shadow effect.  

**Features:**  
✔ Uses SDL2 to render graphics. 🎨  
✔ Simulates light rays interacting with an obstacle. 💡⚫  
✔ Real-time mouse movement detection to update the light source. 🖱️  
</h3>  

## 🚀 How to Run  

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**, **Code::Blocks**, or another C++ IDE that supports SDL2.  
2. Make sure you have **SDL2** installed and properly configured in your IDE. 🔧  
   - You can download SDL2 from [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL).  
3. Set up the correct **SDL2 include** and **library** paths in your IDE’s project settings. 📂  
4. Compile and run the project. ▶️  
5. Use the mouse 🖱️ to move the light source, and hold the left mouse button to see the rays follow the cursor and interact with obstacles.  

**Note**: The rays will stop when they collide with an obstacle (⚫) and create a shadow effect. 🌑  

## 📦 Dependencies  
- **SDL2** (for rendering graphics and handling events) 🎨  
- **C++ Standard Library** 🖥️  

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  
- Add more complex obstacles, like rectangles or polygons. 🔳 🔺  
- Implement reflection and refraction for more realistic lighting effects. 🔄💡  
- Add color variations to the rays and obstacles. 🌈  
- Optimize performance for rendering multiple light sources and obstacles. ⚡  

This project is a simple yet powerful demonstration of basic ray tracing and SDL2 rendering! 🚀✨
